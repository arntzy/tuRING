tuRING is an programming language implementation of a turing machine which 'rewrites' a piano keyboard.



1. The tape is the piano keyboard, not blank to begin with. There are "notes" written to it.

2. A line of code is always written exactly the same.  

SYNTAX: 
(state[note] operator value [move]newstate)



TODO LIST: 

1. Have the master index start on the user-defined first rule.
2. Make sure the head changes directions at the bounds of the piano.
