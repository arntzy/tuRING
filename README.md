tuRING is an programming language implementation of a turing machine which 'rewrites' a piano keyboard.



1. The tape is the piano keyboard, not blank to begin with. There are "notes" written to it.

2. A line  

3. state register: What are the states of my machine? 

do I make decisions about the state based on a tonality? for example: 

Is the source code the state table diagram? 

4. a finite symbol table: Decide on a 5-tuple, or 4-tuple model (qiajâ†’qi1aj1dk) or 




TODO LIST: 

1. Have the master index start on the user-defined first rule.
2. Make sure the head changes directions at the bounds of the piano.
